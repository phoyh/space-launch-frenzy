Small simulation game where each player transitions through the initial stages of a space launch provider company.

In each round, you can:
* Develop new technologies
    * Reliability: increases the chances that the rocket may safely deploy its payload (and you get paid)
    * Reusability: increases the chances that the rocket may land safely and be reused
    * Efficiency: reduces the price tag of building new rockets
* Build a new rocket
    * The rocket's statistics will be frozen according to your technology level at the time of purchase
* Participate in auctions for launch missions
    * The more bids the auction attracts the less you will earn.
* Launch your rocket on a mission
    * This is the automated part - lean back and watch the action unfold!

The game language is German, so be prepared...

Requires [KidBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic-256) as BASIC interpreter.
